# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## Project Overview

The **Movie Rating Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, we can gain insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and create a model that accurately estimates the ratings assigned by users or critics.

This project involves several key steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation. By following this process, we can explore data analysis techniques, implement data preprocessing and feature engineering strategies, and build a regression model for predicting movie ratings.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Data Collection

- Collect historical movie data from reliable sources. You can use datasets available on platforms like Kaggle or IMDb.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them.
- Encode categorical features like genre, director, and actors using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Scale numerical features using methods like Standardization or Min-Max scaling.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Create new features that might capture important information, such as the total number of famous actors in a movie.
- Select relevant features that have a significant impact on movie ratings.

### 4. Data Splitting

- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. A common split ratio is around 70-80% for training and 10-15% for validation and testing.

### 5. Model Selection and Training

- Choose a regression algorithm suitable for the problem, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression.
- Train the selected model using the training dataset.
- Adjust hyperparameters and monitor performance on the validation set.

### 6. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
- Compare the model's performance with different algorithms and hyperparameter settings.

### 7. Model Tuning

- Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

### 8. Final Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the final tuned model on the test set to assess its performance on unseen data.

### 9. Interpretation and Insights

- Analyze the model's coefficients or feature importances to understand which features influence movie ratings the most.
