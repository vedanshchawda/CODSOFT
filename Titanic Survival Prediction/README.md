**Titanic Survival Prediction**

This project uses machine learning to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains information about passengers' age, gender, ticket class, fare, and other attributes. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, we aim to predict survival outcomes for passengers.

-> Steps Involved:-

1) Data Preparation: Load and explore the dataset, handle missing values and select relevant features.
2) Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, engineer new features, and preprocess the data.
3) Model Selection: Choose a suitable algorithm for binary classification.
4) Model Training: Train the chosen algorithm on the training data.
5) Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for predictions and save it for future use.
6) Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
This project is a great opportunity to learn about data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation in a real-world context. It's designed for beginners looking to practice machine learning concepts.
