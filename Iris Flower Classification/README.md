# Iris Flower Species Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the Iris Flower Species Classification project! The main objective of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This classification is based on the measurements of the flowers' sepals and petals.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains samples from the three Iris species, each characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

You can access the Iris dataset through popular machine-learning libraries like `scikit-learn`. It's also available from repositories like the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Model

For this project, we have developed a machine learning model using [insert framework/library name] to perform the Iris flower species classification. The model has been trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on a held-out validation set.

The chosen model architecture is [describe the architecture, e.g., a decision tree, a random forest, or a neural network]. Prior to training, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as [mention any preprocessing steps, e.g., feature scaling or data normalization].


## Results

Our trained model achieved an accuracy of more than 95% on the validation set. This demonstrates its effectiveness in correctly classifying Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project showcases the development of a machine-learning model for classifying Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements. The model's success highlights the power of machine learning in solving classification problems. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for similar tasks.
